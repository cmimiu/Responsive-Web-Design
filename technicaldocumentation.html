        The Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) is a financial aid program that can help you pay for college or university.
OSAP offers funding through:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          grants: money you don’t have to pay back
        </li>
        <li>
         a student loan: money you need to repay once you’re done school
        </li>
      </ul>
	<p>
        When you apply for OSAP, we automatically consider you for both grants and loans. 
	If you don’t want to take a loan, you can decline it after your application is approved.

	There are also programs to help you repay your student loan once you’re done school.
