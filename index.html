  <h3 id="headline">Here are some of my best works! </h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>2020 April</strong>     <a href="http://fsharpllc.com/" target="_blank">FSharpLLC</a>: A website I worked on for my father's Content providing company based in Canada. I used HTML and CSS to style the website, and PHP and Javascript to power animations and servers. It was my first try at making a website and mostly I fixed and edited some of the preinstalled wordpress code and tweaked a lot of the UI elements. But it's still one of my best works!</li>
<li>
<strong>2020 July</strong>     <a href="https://simranfarrukh.godaddysites.com/" target="_blank">Simran Farrukh</a>: This was another attempt at making a website using a CMS. I used a lot of HTML and CSS for this one and limited the Javascript usage. This is a sort of graphics and UX/UI designer portfolio. It shows my design abilities and also a little bit of my other activities.

<strong>2016-2020</strong>     <a href="https://cmimiu.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Mimi's Blogs</a>": One my earliest attempts at making a blogsite and writing blogs. I was a major failoure because I didn't have enough dedication to continue writing and neither did I have the vocabulary for it. But this experience taught me all that I need to know about UI development. I learnt how to create easier entries, how to format pages in a way that it's easier for the user to navigate. Most of my web desgining skills as well as my UX skills are a result of all those hours I wasted away on my computer editing code and settings to make the blog page readable and understandable for the user.
